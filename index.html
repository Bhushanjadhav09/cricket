    <p>The Papua New Guinea men's national cricket team, nicknamed the Barramundis, is the team that represents the
        country of Papua New Guinea in international cricket. The team is organised by Cricket PNG, which has been an
        associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1973.</p>
    <p>The first three batters (number 1, 2, 3) are known as the top order; the next four (numbers 4, 5, 6 and possibly
        7) form the middle order, and the last four (numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11) are the lower order or tail. The
        specialist batters of a team usually bat near the top of the order, so as to score more runs.</p>
    <p>The pitch is a rectangular area in the middle of the field.
        At each end of the pitch are three upright sticks called wickets, with two small pieces of wood called bails on
        top.
        The bowler delivers the ball towards the wicket of the batsman.
        The batsman tries to hit the ball to defend their wicket.
        If the batsman hits the ball, they can run to the other wicket and try to exchange places with the other
        batsman.
        Each time the batsmen switch positions without being put out, they score a run.</p>
